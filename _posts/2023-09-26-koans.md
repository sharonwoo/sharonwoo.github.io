Second post, also brought to you by a bad case of the runs (3kg down since unable to eat - could use more of this!).

Besides [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/Introduction/Named%20arguments/Task.kt), I've also found good old leetcode to be great at revising patterns I need to know for Kotlin. I'm so used to having a for loop look like 

```
fun finalValueAfterOperations(operations: Array<String>): Int {
    var x = 0 
    for (operation in operations) {
        if (operation == "X++" || operation == "++X") {
            x += 1
        } else {
            x -= 1
        }
    }
    return x
}
```

But this is the pattern I see much more often in the codebase (which can be nested):

```
fun finalValueAfterOperations(operations: Array<String>): Int {
    return operations.fold(0) { acc, s ->
        if (s[1] == '+') {
            acc + 1
        } else {
            acc - 1
        }
    }
}
```

Odd that I'm actually getting more out of good old leetcode in the year after my premium subscription expired. But hey, that's what it means to be a developer right? And I guess I finally am one... (talk about burying the lede...)
